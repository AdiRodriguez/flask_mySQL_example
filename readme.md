
# Car Model API with Flask and MySQL

This is a simple Flask application that connects to a MySQL database to fetch car model data and provides an API endpoint to retrieve the information.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Flask application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- MySQL Server

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/car-model-api.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd car-model-api
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### MySQL Configuration

Before running the application, ensure you have a MySQL database set up and the necessary table for storing car model data. Modify the `db_config` dictionary in the `app.py` file with your MySQL connection details:

```python
# MySQL configuration
db_config = {
    'host': 'your_mysql_host',
    'user': 'your_mysql_username',
    'password': 'your_mysql_password',
    'database': 'cars'
}
```

### Running the Application

To start the Flask application, run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

The application will run locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoint

The application provides a single API endpoint:

### Get Car Models

- **URL:** `/car_models`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** A JSON array containing car model data with attributes `id`, `type`, `color`, and `model`.
